Advantage of cssSelector?
1. It is faster compare to xpath especially in the IE browser
2. In IE cssSelector suits better than the Xpath. Bcoz IE browsers doesnot have well defined xpath engine.

Dis-Advantages:
1. It doesnot supports index.
2. It doesnot support 'and' & 'or' logical operators
3. It doesnot support text() method.
4. It doesnot travels in all the directions unlike xpath

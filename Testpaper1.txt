Core Java Questions:

1. What is encapsulation? WAP to access the private members of the class?

2. What is abstraction? WAP for the abstraction?

3. What are the difference between abstract class and interface?

4. WAP to check that the given number is prime or not?

5. WAP to read the .txt file using FileInputStream class. Make sure it only displays vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from the file if exists?

6. WAP to add only the even numbers from the both arrays?

7. Explain the responsibility of the child class in the inheritance at abstract class & interface level?

8. The folder contains different files like .txt, .xlsx, .zip etc. WAP to findout how many .txt files are present?

9. The folder contains 10 files and folders. Read the names of files and folders & display them in the sorted order?

10. WAP to create the nested directories without using the .mkDirs() method?

11. What is the outout of the below code? Explain with reasons. Fix the code and execute all the methods available in all the classes using single object?

abstarct class Parent{
   abstract void method1();
   abstract void method2();
   public void a() {System.out.println("Parent: method a()");}
}

class Child extends Parent{
   abstract void method3();
   public void b() {System.out.println("Child: method b()");}
}

class GrandChild extends Child{
    void method3() {System.out.println("GrandChild implemented method3() abstract method")}
}

public class InheritanceDemo{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
       //Here using one object you should run all the methods
   }
}

12. WAP to demonstrate the compile time polymorphism in java?

13. There is a folder whicj contains 7 folders. WAP to Rename them to weekday name?

14. What is the difference between throw and throws with example code?

15. Explain the finally block?

16. What is the output of the below code?
public static void main(String[] args)
{
	String str = null;
    try{
	   str = "Good morning";
	   System.out.print(str);
	   System.out.print();
	   System.out.print("**********");
	   str = "Good Day";
	   System.out.print(str);
	   throw IllegalArgumentException("Custom exception message");
	}catch(Exception e)
	{
	   System.out.println("Encoutered exception");
	}
	finally{
	   System.out.println("Executing finally block");
	   str = null;
	}
}


17. WAP for the below explained logic to find the one missing number from the sorted array?
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8};
 (a) Read the max value from the array & add all the values in that range (means 1 to max number)
 (b) Add all the numbers available in the array
 (c) substract the output of step (a) with step (b) the nyou will get the one missign number
 
 
18. WAP to replace all the odd values of the array 1 with even values of the array 2?
ex: int a[] = {1, 2, 3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8 ,9, 10};
int b[] = {12, 14, 16, 18, 20};
The resultant array should be as follows:
int a[] = {12, 2, 14 ,4 ,16 ,6 ,18 ,8 ,20, 10};


19. WAP to replace the 2nd & subsiquent occurrance of the character with under score (_)
   Ex: india is great
       ind_a _s gre_t 

20. find out AMAZON is present in the given string "MAZOAN"?
 

1. copy the questions (with out delete/modify) into notepad
